              During my time at Trent University I helped lead the re-design of
              the MyCommunity website. This website was used by alumni and
              donors to keep up with Trent University news stories, access
              alumni services and access donation forms. This website was built
              on Blackbaud's NetCommunity platform allowing connections to their
              Raiser's Edge Software which is a database software used for
              fundraising and non-profits.

              Dane Bland is running for the provincial Ontario Liberal Party
              nomination for Peterborough Kawartha. He is a former colleague of
              mine at Trent University and when he was having some trouble
              setting up his website he reached out to me for assistance. I was
              able to assist him naviagte the Nationbuilder platform he was
              using due to it's fundraising application. I was able to help him
              set up his website with a custom domain and add custom content. I
              remain on call ready to assist him when needed.
